# Contributing Guide

> Note: The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as a title will be closed immediately.
Please be sure to check every box in the PR template.

## Before adding something to the list

1. Make sure you are editing README.md only; no other files are allowed to be edited.
2. Add your item to the category it belongs to. Try to avoid creating completely new categories.
3. Be sure to add your item in the correct alphabetical order for its section.
4. Don't submit dead links and try to always submit HTTPS links.
5. Linking to resources in languages other than English is welcome and encouraged.
6. Add something that is truly awesome and stands out.

### Adding an item to the list

1. Click README.md
2. Click the **pencil button** ✏️ in the upper right corner next to `raw | blame | history`.
3. Github will automatically create a fork for this repo in your account.
4. Add your edit to the README.md.
5. At the bottom of the page fill in a meaningful commit summary and click **Propose file change**.
6. You'll be taken to the PR screen, click the **Create Pull Request** button.
7. Make sure you check the boxes (and actually confirm they're correct) and click **Create Pull Request**.

Submitted PRs will be checked as soon as possible. If something is incorrect it will be labeled `awaiting-user` with the problem stated in the PR comments.
If a PR becomes stale or no action is taken after some time with the PR being labeled `awaiting-user`, this PR will get the `reply-timeout` label and will be closed.



### Github links

Specifying a Github link lets developers contribute to an open source project based on RaspAP.
There are some interesting forks of RaspAP in the wild. Let's showcase them!

You may add your Github link if the following conditions are true:
- The documentation (README) contains a description of the project, illustration of the project with a demo or screenshots and a CONTRIBUTING section.
- The project is active and maintained.
- The project accepts contributions.

Example of addition:
```
| Name | [github](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui), [website](https://raspap.com) | Description | v2.0-beta |
```

The link provided should be the link of the github repository, not the demo.
